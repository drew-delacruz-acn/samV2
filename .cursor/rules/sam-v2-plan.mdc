# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Fine-Tuning SAM2 with a Dummy Dataset

## 1. Overview
This project aims to fine-tune the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) using a synthetic (dummy) dataset that mimics the object identification challenges found in Marvel movies. The goal is to enhance SAM2’s ability to handle specific difficulties such as fast-moving objects, special effects, unusual shapes, occlusions, and lighting variations. The fine-tuned model will be evaluated on a separate test set from the dummy dataset to confirm improved performance.

This PRD outlines the steps for generating the dataset, setting up the environment, fine-tuning the model, and evaluating the results, ensuring the development team (e.g., Cursor) can execute the task efficiently.

---

## 2. Objectives
- **Primary Objective**: Fine-tune SAM2 to improve its segmentation performance on a synthetic dataset replicating Marvel movie challenges.
- **Secondary Objectives**:
  - Create a synthetic dataset with fictional objects and segmentation masks.
  - Develop a training pipeline to fine-tune SAM2 using the dataset.
  - Assess the fine-tuned model’s effectiveness on a test set.

---

## 3. Functional Requirements
The project is divided into sequential steps, each with specific tasks, tools, and expected outcomes.

### 3.1 Step 1: Research and Understand SAM2
**Objective**: Understand SAM2’s architecture, inputs, and fine-tuning process.

**Tasks**:
- Review SAM2’s official documentation or GitHub repository.
- Confirm input formats (e.g., images, masks, prompts) and fine-tuning support.
- Identify dependencies (e.g., PyTorch) and hardware needs (e.g., GPU).

**Expected Outcome**:
- A summary of SAM2’s requirements and capabilities.
- A list of dependencies and hardware specifications.

---

### 3.2 Step 2: Design and Generate a Dummy Dataset
**Objective**: Create a synthetic dataset simulating Marvel movie challenges.

**Challenges to Include**:
- Fast movement (e.g., motion blur)
- Special effects (e.g., glowing objects)
- Unusual shapes (e.g., irregular costumes)
- Occlusions (e.g., overlapping objects)
- Lighting variations

**Tasks**:
- **Define Objects**: Start with simple shapes (e.g., circles) that move, then add complexity (e.g., irregular shapes).
- **Generate Synthetic Videos**:
  - Use Python with OpenCV or PIL to create videos and masks.
  - Incorporate challenges like speed, overlap, and blur.
- **Sample Code**:
  ```python
  import cv2
  import numpy as np
  import os

  def generate_dummy_video(video_path, mask_dir, num_frames=100, width=640, height=480):
      fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')
      video = cv2.VideoWriter(video_path, fourcc, 30.0, (width, height))
      os.makedirs(mask_dir, exist_ok=True)

      x, y = width // 4, height // 2  # Initial position
      radius = 50
      speed = 5

      for i in range(num_frames):
          frame = np.zeros((height, width, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
          cv2.circle(frame, (x, y), radius, (255, 255, 255), -1)
          video.write(frame)

          mask = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=np.uint8)
          cv2.circle(mask, (x, y), radius, 255, -1)
          cv2.imwrite(os.path.join(mask_dir, f'frame_{i:04d}.png'), mask)

          x += speed  # Move object
          if x > width - radius:
              x = radius  # Reset position

      video.release()
  ```

**Expected Outcome**:
- At least one synthetic video (e.g., `dummy_video.mp4`) and frame-wise masks (e.g., `masks/frame_0000.png`).

---

### 3.3 Step 3: Prepare the Dataset for Training
**Objective**: Format the synthetic data for SAM2’s training pipeline.

**Tasks**:
- Verify SAM2’s input requirements (e.g., image-mask pairs).
- Organize files:
  - Videos in `videos/`.
  - Masks in `masks/`.
- Create a PyTorch Dataset class:
  ```python
  from torch.utils.data import Dataset
  import cv2
  import os

  class DummyDataset(Dataset):
      def __init__(self, video_path, mask_dir):
          self.video = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
          self.mask_dir = mask_dir
          self.num_frames = int(self.video.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT))

      def __len__(self):
          return self.num_frames

      def __getitem__(self, idx):
          self.video.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_POS_FRAMES, idx)
          ret, frame = self.video.read()
          frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
          mask_path = os.path.join(self.mask_dir, f'frame_{idx:04d}.png')
          mask = cv2.imread(mask_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
          return frame, mask  # Add preprocessing if needed
  ```

**Expected Outcome**:
- A formatted dataset with a custom PyTorch Dataset class.

---

### 3.4 Step 4: Set Up the Fine-Tuning Environment
**Objective**: Prepare the development environment.

**Tasks**:
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install torch torchvision opencv-python
  ```
- Download SAM2’s pre-trained weights from its official source.
- Confirm GPU access (or adjust for CPU).

**Expected Outcome**:
- A ready environment with dependencies and SAM2 weights.

---

### 3.5 Step 5: Implement the Fine-Tuning Code
**Objective**: Develop the fine-tuning script.

**Tasks**:
- Load SAM2 with pre-trained weights.
- Set up a DataLoader:
  ```python
  from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
  dataset = DummyDataset('videos/dummy_video.mp4', 'masks/')
  dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True)
  ```
- Define optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss (e.g., cross-entropy).
- Write training loop:
  ```python
  num_epochs = 10
  for epoch in range(num_epochs):
      for images, masks in dataloader:
          optimizer.zero_grad()
          outputs = model(images)  # Adjust per SAM2 API
          loss = compute_loss(outputs, masks)  # Define loss
          loss.backward()
          optimizer.step()
      print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')
  ```
- Note: Adapt `model(images)` and `compute_loss` to SAM2’s API.

**Expected Outcome**:
- A functional training script.

---

### 3.6 Step 6: Execute the Training
**Objective**: Run the fine-tuning process.

**Tasks**:
- Run the script:
  ```bash
  python train_sam2.py
  ```
- Monitor loss and tweak hyperparameters if needed.

**Expected Outcome**:
- A fine-tuned SAM2 model.

---

### 3.7 Step 7: Evaluate the Fine-Tuned Model
**Objective**: Test the model on a separate test set.

**Tasks**:
- Use or generate a separate synthetic video for testing.
- Compare predictions to ground truth masks (e.g., IoU, Dice score).
- Visualize results.

**Expected Outcome**:
- Performance metrics and visualizations showing improvement.

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Training should finish within hours on a GPU.
- **Scalability**: Pipeline should support larger datasets.
- **Usability**: Code must include clear documentation.

---

## 5. Deliverables
- **Fine-Tuned Model**: SAM2 adapted to the synthetic dataset.
- **Synthetic Dataset**: Videos and masks.
- **Code**: Scripts for dataset creation, training, and evaluation.
- **Documentation**: Report on process, challenges, and results.

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- Dataset includes at least three challenges (e.g., motion, occlusions).
- Fine-tuned model outperforms pre-trained SAM2 on test set metrics.
- Training runs error-free with documented results.
