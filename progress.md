# SAM2 Fine-Tuning Project Progress Log

## 2023-07-12: Project Setup

- Created project repository and directory structure
- Initialized progress log to track development
- Created the following files:
  - `requirements.txt`: Dependencies for the project
  - `README.md`: Project documentation and instructions
  - `src/dataset_generator.py`: Script to generate synthetic dataset
  - `src/dataset.py`: PyTorch dataset classes for training
  - `src/train.py`: Training script for fine-tuning SAM2
  - `src/evaluate.py`: Evaluation script for testing model performance
- Added setup script (`setup.sh`) for environment initialization
- Created notebooks directory with README for interactive demos
- Implemented a placeholder for SAM2 model (to be replaced with actual model)

## 2023-07-13: SAM2 Integration

- Updated `requirements.txt` to use the official SAM2 repository
- Modified `src/train.py` to use the official SAM2 model
- Updated `src/evaluate.py` to support the SAM2 model interface
- Created `src/inference.py` for direct inference with SAM2 on synthetic videos
- Added support for different SAM2 model sizes (tiny, small, base, large)
- Implemented fallback mechanisms if SAM2 is not available

## Project Status: SAM2 Integration Complete

The project has been updated to use the official SAM2 model from Meta AI. The next steps involve:

1. Set up a Python environment and install dependencies:
   ```
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. Generate the synthetic dataset:
   ```
   python src/dataset_generator.py
   ```

3. Run SAM2 inference on the synthetic dataset:
   ```
   python src/inference.py --video_dir dataset/test/video1 --output_dir inference_results/video1 --model_size small
   ```

4. (Optional) Fine-tune SAM2 on the synthetic dataset:
   ```
   python src/train.py --model_size small
   ```

5. Evaluate the fine-tuned model:
   ```
   python src/evaluate.py --checkpoint models/best_model.pth --model_size small
   ```

## Notes

- SAM2 is now available from the official repository at https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2
- Multiple model sizes are available to accommodate different computational resources
- The current implementation provides both a direct inference path and a fine-tuning path
- For fine-tuning, additional work may be needed based on the SAM2 training API
- The synthetic dataset generator creates videos with moving circles and corresponding binary masks
- The training script includes a DICE loss function which is appropriate for segmentation tasks
