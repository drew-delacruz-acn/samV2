# SAM2 Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project explores the capabilities of Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for object tracking and segmentation, with a specific focus on its potential application to tracking objects in dynamic video sequences.

## Key Components and Findings

### 1. Environment and Setup
- **Platform**: macOS (darwin 23.5.0)
- **Model**: SAM2 ('facebook/sam2-hiera-tiny')
- **Processing**: CPU-based inference (CUDA not available)
- **Dependencies**: PyTorch 2.6.0, OpenCV, NumPy

### 2. Data Generation
We created several types of test data:

#### Simple Test Images
- Black square (100x100) on white background (480x480)
- Used for basic segmentation testing
- Generated using OpenCV for consistent results

#### Synthetic Dataset
Created a comprehensive dataset with:
- **Training Set** (3 videos):
  1. Horizontal movement (left to right)
  2. Vertical movement (top to bottom)
  3. Diagonal movements with two objects
- **Test Set** (2 videos):
  1. Circular path movement
  2. Random movement with two objects
- Each video: 100 frames, 640x480 pixels
- Includes both frames and segmentation masks

### 3. Testing Methodology

#### Image Segmentation Tests: How We Tested Still Images
Imagine you have a photo and you want the computer to find and outline objects in it. Here's how we tested this:

1. **The Grid System** (3Ã—3 points):
   ```
   X --- X --- X
   |     |     |
   X --- X --- X
   |     |     |
   X --- X --- X
   ```
   - We placed 9 dots on the image (like a tic-tac-toe board)
   - Each 'X' is a point where we asked the model "What do you see here?"
   - This helps us test if the model can find objects in different parts of the image

2. **What Happens at Each Point**:
   - When we click a point, the model tries to find what object is there
   - It creates a mask (like tracing with a marker) around what it thinks is the object
   - Example: If we click on a square, it should outline the whole square

3. **Multiple Predictions**:
   - For each point, the model gives us several possible outlines
   - Think of it like the model saying "It could be this... or maybe this..."
   - We can then pick the best one

4. **Quality Check**:
   - We compared what the model outlined vs. what we know is there
   - For our test image (black square), we checked if it found the square's edges correctly
   - We also checked if it worked equally well at all 9 points

#### Video Tracking Tests: How We Tested Moving Objects

1. **Basic Setup**:
   ```
   Frame 1 --> Frame 2 --> Frame 3 --> ...
   [ðŸ‘†Point]   [Track]    [Track]    [Track]
   ```
   - We only need to point at the object in the first frame
   - After that, the model tries to follow it automatically

2. **Step by Step Process**:
   a. **First Frame**:
      - We click on the object we want to track (like pointing and saying "follow this!")
      - The model creates an outline around it
   
   b. **Following Frames**:
      - The model tries to find the same object in each new frame
      - It updates the outline as the object moves
      - Like playing "follow the leader" with the object

3. **What We Checked**:
   - Did it keep tracking the right object?
   - Did the outline stay accurate as the object moved?
   - Did it work with different movement patterns?
     * Horizontal (left to right)
     * Vertical (up and down)
     * Circular (going in circles)
     * Random movement

4. **Results We Saved**:
   - Original video frames (what we started with)
   - Mask frames (the outlines the model created)
   - Combined view (original video with outlines overlaid)
   - This helps us see how well the tracking worked

#### Why This Testing Approach Works
- The grid system helps us test the whole image systematically
- Testing with simple shapes first (like our black square) helps us understand the basics
- Moving to video lets us test more complex scenarios
- We can clearly see what works and what doesn't

#### Example Results
```
Original Image:   Model's Outline:   Combined:
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ        â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ         â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬›â¬›â¬œâ¬œ   â†’   â¬œðŸ”´ðŸ”´â¬œâ¬œ    =    â¬œðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬›â¬›â¬œâ¬œ        â¬œðŸ”´ðŸ”´â¬œâ¬œ         â¬œðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ        â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ         â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```
(Where â¬› is our test square, ðŸ”´ is the model's outline, and ðŸŸ¥ shows the overlay)
